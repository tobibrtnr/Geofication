        or store any data, including personal information or location data, on external servers.
        <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
        Geofication uses Google Play Services and the Google Maps SDK for functionality such as location-based
        notifications. While we do not actively collect any data, these services may collect data according to their own
        policies. For more information, please refer to <a target="_blank"

          Service</a>.
        <h3>GDPR Compliance</h3>
        For users in the EEA, you have the right to access, correct, delete, and limit the processing of your data.
        However,
        as no data is collected or stored by Geofication, these rights are inherently protected. However, you are able
        to
        delete your local saved data in the app.
